<h1> Welcome To My World</h1>
<p> I am <strong> Just Smile. </strong> A graduate of Accounting but now taking a dive into Web development. I started learning html and css as a new year goal on the 01/01/2020. So far it has been an interesting journey as i have met with some challenges which made me think if coding was really what i wanna do... But with all the challenges faced so far, i have realized that it is so much interesting and fulfilling when i put in time to figure out the solution to the problem. Which i think is the best part of coding for me so far. I enjoy it. I hope to start building projects and exploring the creative part of coding. </p>
